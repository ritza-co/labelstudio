We 
will 
not 
attempt 
to 
answer 
these 
questions 
, 
by 
the 
way 
, 
in 
this TIME
hour TIME
. 
I 
just 
want 
to 
just 
give 
you 
a 
sense 
of 
scope 
here 
, 
just 
modest 
scope 
. 
But 
what 
we 
want 
to 
talk 
about 
is 
what 
happened 
to 
Kevin PERSON
Kelly PERSON
. 
What 
happened 
is 
that 
at 
the DATE
age DATE
of DATE
27 DATE
, 
all 
of 
this 
changed 
when 
he 
came 
into 
Jerusalem 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
Easter 
and 
Passover 
. 
It 
was 
the DATE
same DATE
weekend DATE
. 
And 
flocks 
of 
people 
are 
coming 
into 
the 
city 
. 
----------
So 
I 
entered 
Jerusalem 
on 
Easter GPE
with 
a 
simple 
expectation 
that 
I 
was 
going 
to 
photograph 
another 
religious 
ceremony 
, 
another 
religious 
festival 
. 
And 
then 
, 
for 
various 
reasons 
, 
I 
got 
locked 
out 
of 
my 
hostel 
room 
. 
They 
had 
a 
curfew 
. 
And 
I 
did 
n't 
make 
it 
back 
in 
time 
. 
And 
I 
was 
in 
quite 
a 
fix 
because 
I 
was 
a 
stranger 
in 
this 
very 
strange 
town 
. 
When 
it 
happened 
, 
I 
did 
n't 
have 
enough 
money 
to 
stay 
elsewhere 
, 
nor 
did 
I 
even 
have 
knowledge 
of 
where 
to 
go 
. 
----------
I 
slept 
there 
until 
early TIME
morning TIME
, 
when 
the 
activity 
started 
to 
increase 
, 
and 
people 
started 
coming 
in 
. 
And 
I 
went 
out 
and 
followed 
the 
crowd 
where 
it 
was 
going 
when 
they 
were 
going 
out 
to 
the 
tombs 
area 
in 
Jerusalem GPE
. 
And 
I 
went 
out 
. 
And 
there 
were 
some 
folding 
chairs 
set 
up 
in 
front 
of 
this 
tomb 
area 
. 
And 
as 
the 
sun 
was 
coming 
up 
on 
that 
Easter 
morning 
, 
I 
was 
staring 
at 
empty 
tombs 
. 
And 
for 
a 
reason 
that 
I 
can 
not 
comprehend 
, 
as 
I 
sat 
on 
that 
chair 
contemplating 
this 
view 
of 
the 
early 
sun 
morning 
coming 
into 
the 
empty 
tombs 
, 
all 
that 
I 
had 
been 
wrestling 
with 
for 
the 
past 
many 
, 
many 
years 
in 
thinking 
about 
religion 
sort 
of 
became 
resolved 
in 
my 
mind 
. 
And 
at 
that 
very 
moment 
, 
I 
believed 
that 
Jesus 
Christ 
had 
, 
indeed 
, 
risen 
from 
those 
tombs 
. 
----------
Shall 
we 
take 
the ORG
Easter ORG
Bunny ORG
and 
Santa ORG
Claus ORG
in 
that 
context 
too 
, 
that 
your 
parents 
told 
you 
that 
this 
man 
is 
Santa ORG
Claus ORG
? 
Do 
you 
hate 
your 
parents 
or 
distrust 
your 
parents 
' 
judgment 
from 
that 
point 
on 
? 
When 
you 
were 
a 
child 
, 
you 
were 
given 
just 
enough 
information 
to 
live 
your 
life 
. 
They 
did 
n't 
tell 
you 
that 
the 
landlord 
's 
going 
to 
throw 
you 
out 
of 
the 
house 
. 
They 
did 
n't 
tell 
you 
that 
your 
father 
's 
going 
to 
lose 
his 
job 
. 
They 
did 
n't 
tell 
you 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
things 
that 
could 
hurt 
you 
, 
because 
they 
were 
your 
parents 
. 
Their 
job 
was 
to 
protect 
you 
. 
----------
But 
all 
that 
changed 
. 
When 
he 
was 
27 DATE
, 
he 
came 
into 
Jerusalem GPE
. 
It 
was 
the DATE
weekend DATE
of 
both 
Easter PERSON
and 
Passover 
, 
and 
the 
city 
was 
flooded 
with 
tourists 
. 
----------
  
So 
I 
entered 
Jerusalem 
on 
Easter 
with 
the 
simple 
expectation 
that 
I 
was 
going 
to 
photograph 
yet 
another 
religious 
ceremony 
, 
another 
religious 
festival 
. 
And 
then 
for 
various 
reasons 
I 
got 
locked 
out 
of 
my 
hostel 
room 
. 
They 
had 
a 
curfew 
, 
and 
I 
did 
n't 
make 
it 
back 
in 
time 
. 
And 
I 
was 
in 
quite 
a 
fix 
because 
I 
was 
a 
stranger 
in 
this 
very 
strange 
town 
. 
When 
it 
happened 
, 
I 
did 
n't 
have 
enough 
money 
to 
stay 
elsewhere 
, 
nor 
did 
I 
even 
have 
knowledge 
of 
where 
to 
go 
. 
----------
I 
slept 
there 
until 
early TIME
morning TIME
, 
when 
the 
activities 
started 
to 
increase 
, 
and 
people 
started 
coming

. 
And 
I 
went 
out 
and 
followed 
the 
crowd 
where 
it 
was 
going 
when 
they 
were 
going 
out 
to 
the 
tombs 
area 
in 
Jerusalem GPE
. 
And 
I 
went 
out 
, 
and 
there 
were 
some 
folding 
chairs 
set 
up 
in 
front 
of 
this 
tomb 
area 
. 
And 
as 
the 
sun 
was 
coming 
up 
on 
that 
Easter 
morning 
, 
I 
was 
staring 
at 
empty 
tombs 
. 
----------
  
We 
had 
Easter ORG
dinner 
at 
John 
's 
house 
. 
A 
big 
afternoon TIME
meal 
, 
which 
we 
ate 
in 
his 
backyard 
. 
Everyone 
had 
taken 
their 
places 
at 
the 
table 
, 
when 
I 
excused 
myself 
to 
visit 
the 
bathroom 
. 
And 
there 
, 
in 
the 
toilet 
, 
was 
the 
absolute 
biggest 
turd 
I 
have 
ever 
seen 
in 
my 
life 
, 
no 
toilet 
paper 
or 
anything 
, 
just 
this 
thick 
and 
coiled 
specimen 
. 
----------
And 
then 
, 
we 
had 
Easter ORG
dinner 
at 
John 
's 
house 
on 
Irving ORG
. 
A 
big 
sit 
- 
down 
meal 
in 
daytime TIME
's 
unnerving 
. 
For 
me 
, 
anyway 
, 
I 
like 
to 
eat 
later 
. 
I 
took 
some 
roast 
lamb 
, 
a 
couple 
potaters 
, 
and 
carried 
my 
plate 
outside 
to 
the 
lawn 
, 
to 
a 
table 
he 
'd 
covered 
in 
bright 
pink 
chiffon 
. 
I 
'd 
had 
a 
few 
beers 
and 
a 
glass 
of 
chablis 
and 
thought 
, 
before 
eating 
, 
I 
might 
want 
to 
pee 
. 
----------
I 
found 
a 
writing 
assignment 
by 
a 
local 
community 
college 
student 
in 
a 
totalled 
Chevy ORG
van 
. 
Apparently 
, 
he 
had 
n't 
learned 
his 
lesson
